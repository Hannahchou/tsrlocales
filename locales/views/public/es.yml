    faq: 
      s1: "Frequently asked questions"
      s10: "5. How do you score my grades? Is it better to have more A’s or to have more internships?"
      s11: "We use an algorithm that relies on the hours invested in an activity to calculate a total point value. Certain achievements, such as your university and secondary school grades, carry an additional multiplier that increases the total value and make this achievement more important for the final result. However, internships can also provide quite a few points, so if you are choosing between spending the summer watching TV and doing an internship, the internship is definitely the way to go."
      s12: "6. Any tips for students who want to lead in the ranking?"
      s13: "Leading students in general have good grades, a few internships and well-rounded social and language skills. This is normally the result of a steady and regular investment in their skills. Just think about your interests and then pursue activities that are worthwhile in that field. Whether you work part-time, do an internship or add additional coursework, you will quickly move up in the ranking and make your profile more attractive."
      s14: "Another tip: Business life is a marathon, not a sprint. If you want to sustain high performance, you need to treat your body and brain perfectly. When you are getting tired and unfocused, go to sleep, as this is what your body needs. And once you wake up again, work on creating something useful. This will not only lead to a good ranking result, but also to a happy and fulfilled life."
      s15: "7. The quality of education and grade scales in general differ between countries. How does the system reflect that?"
      s16: "There is a huge diversity in grade scales and the levels of teaching, not only between countries, but even within individual countries. Our ranking system cannot evaluate every single course and the quality of the education provided by each school. We do, however, look at the average grades that students from each university have earned and provide this information on the university ranking page to discourage grade inflation. Globally, grade inflation may lead to slightly skewed results between countries, but once you narrow down the ranking to the national level, the picture should be a bit clearer. In terms of hiring, employers generally evaluate candidates’ educational backgrounds and grades earned according to their past experience. Having “average” grades in a difficult field of study is still seen as very positive."
      s17: "8. Do I have to provide any certificates to verify my profile?"
      s18: "We do not require certification to take part in the ranking. Employers, however, will generally prefer a complete profile that includes uploaded transcripts and additional documentation, and our ranking also provides a slight bonus for verified candidates. Once employers contact you, they will inquire about your skills and normally demand to see the original documents. If candidates are unable to provide them on request, then this normally leads to termination (even after contracts are signed) and may even result in legal proceedings."
      s18a: "9. Is my position in the ranking visible to friends, colleagues, and other users?"
      s18b: "Your information is private if you wish. You can always manage the visibility of your profile in your account and can change your preferred settings at any time."
      s19: "10. What happens with my data?"
      s2: "1. How can I participate in the ranking? Do I have to pay for being ranked?"
      s20: "You are in control of your data. If you want to be found by employers and receive job offers from employers, then you should allow employers to view detailed information. If you would like to be invisible to the public on the global student ranking page, then it is easy to change the settings to hide your information."
      s21: "11. Is it worth it to cheat the system?"
      s22: "Not really. It’s probably possible to lead in the ranking for a while until the account becomes flagged, modified or banned. The system has some built-in measures to find and flag suspicious accounts. Once an account is flagged, it will be invisible to others, and only the user and our administrators can see it. Upon review, our administrators will release the account, request you to verify certain information, and modify or ban the account. And Employers will generally want to see the originals of all transcripts before hiring someone. On top of that, fabricating documents is fraud and can lead to legal actions."
      s23: "12. What can I do if I do not agree with my position in the ranking?"
      s24: "If you think that the system lacks a key measure of your achievements and should be modified to include them, send us an e-mail. Our team regularly reviews ideas and we will adapt the system based on good suggestions – this might take a few days. If you would like to earn more points in general, feel free to add more details about yourself, and don’t forget to upload certificates."
      s25: "13. Can the platform help to fight unemployment in my country?"
      s26: "Yes, because information is key. High unemployment is strongly correlated to the low availability of information about job opportunities coupled with willingness to relocate. If candidates from COUNTRY are willing to move to other places that provide better economic conditions, then our platform facilitates that through the global ranking system."
      s27: "14. How much does the ranking cost?"
      s28: "It’s free and will always be free for students and graduates. Employers pay to post jobs and to advertise, which covers our salaries."
      s29: "15. How can I track my ranking?"
      s3: "It’s free. Just sign up through your Facebook account or by e-mail. Once you enter your achievements, the system will calculate your score and compare you with your friends."
      s30: "You may want to come back regularly to add new achievements to your profile. Just finished an internship? Earned a certificate for your language skills? Feel free to add them and to recalculate your current ranking position."
      s31: "16. How can I track my applications?"
      s32: "Our system will provide you with a brief overview of jobs you have already applied for. Right now we are still testing that feature but it should be ready in a few weeks."
      s33: "17. I finished university and have found a job. Should I keep my profile?"
      s34: "Feel free to keep your account and to update it now and then. Other people in your age group will probably do the same and you can still compare yourself with your friends and with everyone else. And you may still receive job offers occasionally. You never know whom the recruiters are looking for and what kind of opportunity may arise."
      s35: "18. Can I pay to increase the number of viewers of my profile?"
      s36: "No. It’s all about achievements."
      s37: "19. Does my account have an expiration date?"
      s38: "No, there is no deadline for your account, but employers can see your activity level on the platform. Checking in every few days when you are actually looking for jobs will keep the activity level high and recruiters filtering by activity level will find you more easily. Simply put: Keeping your profile updated will make you more likely to be contacted, but the account won’t be deleted on inactivity."
      s39: "20. Is the system perfect?"
      s4: "2. I think I am average or below average. Should I join?"
      s40: "It’s quite good. We are a bit surprised ourselves! We find that the ranking provides a pretty nuanced and fair picture overall, by taking so many different factors into account. As we find ways to improve the quality of the ranking and the system further, we will continue to work on it. Suggestions are always welcome!"
      s41: "Technical questions"
      s42: "21. What if I need to recover my password?"
      s43: "Just attempt to log in and click the “recover password” button. If you can’t access the e-mail account you registered through, then you will need to contact one of the country managers and provide a copy of your passport or government ID to reset the account. This process may take a few days, in order to discourage social hacking attempts."
      s44: "22. What happens if I don’t receive the password reset e-mail?"
      s45: "Please check your spam folder first, and if you do not find it there, retype the correct e-mail address into the field. Typos happen. Depending on the traffic, sending the e-mail might take a few minutes—the internet is slow sometimes."
      s46: "23. Should I provide my password to someone else?"
      s47: "Do not provide your password to anyone. This includes administrators, country managers, staff members, friends, or kind strangers on the train. We can access the system and all profiles without passwords and will never ask you to reveal your password to anyone."
      s48: "24. How can I delete my account?"
      s49: "Just send an e-mail to info@thestudentranking.com from the e-mail address you used to create the account. We will review your request and delete your account, with no questions asked."
      s5: "Yes, because each individual is unique and can still benefit from the ranking. The ranking results and advice will help you to find out how to become better and more valuable. And even if the ranking score doesn’t put you in your desired ranking group, you are still unique due to your specific combination of your experience, skills, and location. This makes you interesting for employers looking for that specific combination. You never know what employers are looking for!"
      s50: "25. If I request account deletion, will my results still remain in the ranking?"
      s51: "No, your results will be removed from the ranking. We delete all of your data and nothing will remain."
      s52: "26. Will spammers get my e-mail address?"
      s53: "Nobody likes spam. We will keep your e-mail address confidential, and it will never be provided to partners, sponsors, or other groups. That’s not how we roll."
      s54: "For employers and recruiters"
      s55: "27. What are you offering?"
      s56: "We help employers find ideal student or graduate talent worldwide quickly by providing a truly global, ranked database of candidates. Whether you are looking for the top five percent of each class or want to recruit someone with a unique set of skills, we can help you. We offer students a global ranking that allows them to learn about their market value and job opportunities from great employers. On top of that, we also publish a biannual university ranking, based on the quality of students attending each university."
      s57: "28. How does your ranking work?"
      s58: "Students earn points for each achievement entered. Achievements include university degrees, secondary education grades, work experience, language and personal skills, and other factors that make them unique and demonstrate their competence. We then use these points to compare students of a similar age in our global ranking and allow further filtering based on degree, location, nationality, and other relevant properties.  Employers can also filter candidates based on graduation date or availability and interest in full-time, part-time, or intern positions."
      s59: "29. How many users do you have? How fast are you growing?"
      s6: "3. How is the work experience relevant? If I have lots of work experience, can I still register?"
      s60: "We have just launched and only have the users from the initial testing phase. With the multiplication factor and word-of-mouth through social networks, we expect to have a few thousand users within the two weeks of our launch and to reach 20,000 users by the end of April 2013. This growth should then continue until a certain saturation point is reached."
      s61: "30. How reliable are the results of the ranking?"
      s62: "The reliability of the ranking depends on the quality of the data provided. We use a variety of measures to encourage our users to provide valid and certifiable information. Our system flags accounts that try to create improbable profiles and our administrators review both flagged and new profiles daily. The system also rewards users who upload certificates and transcripts to the site to increase the quality of their profile."
      s63: "31. Is the data statistically significant?"
      s64: "The ranking becomes more statistically significant with every new student that joins.  Depending on the level of analysis and the number of users on the site, we will be able to provide highly significant analyses into the global or national talent pool within the next few months."
      s65: "32. Why should we post our jobs on your site?"
      s66: "Because you want to get the best candidates and we can help you in finding them. Almost every student wants to find out how they are doing compared with others, which leads them to our site.  And our ranking makes it easy for you to find and contact the best candidates quickly. Posting a job offer then increases the speed of the process by allowing students who are actively searching for positions to express their interest. Try it now—your first job post is free."
      s67: "33. Do you want to compete with services such as LinkedIn and Monster.com?"
      s68: "We provide a great alternative for students and employers to connect directly, and both LinkedIn and Monster are big players in the professional field. Our advantage is that we are focused on a specific target group and want to provide great job matching opportunities for our users, while making it easier for employers to find talent globally through our ranking. Other providers cannot offer this."
      s69: "34. How do you prevent users from entering false data?"
      s7: "Yes. You will receive an evaluation based on a comparison with your peers. The employers using our system look for all different kinds of candidates, and they may be interested in your profile, especially if you bring significant work experience to the table."
      s70: "Our system has visible and invisible filtering systems, which validate data upon entry and perform “sanity checks” on completed profiles. We automatically flag and filter suspicious accounts and our administrators can then clear, modify, or delete profiles. With the amount of effort that is involved in creating confirmed and socially verified accounts, cheating the system would be prohibitively time-consuming."
      s71: "35. How much does it cost to post job openings and events? "
      s72: "It’s free for your first job posting, and services in general are priced very competitively. Please consult the “Pricing” section of our website to find out full details. If you have many job offers or want to become a partner, then contacting a country manager directly is a good way to get the best package."
      s73: "36. How can I make my job openings more visible?"
      s74: "You can add a logo to your job opening to benefit from higher visibility in the ranking results. In addition, you can use advertising on the site to draw a bigger audience to your company or the job post in question. And if you want to actively target the best candidates, then launching an e-mail marketing campaign to a selected group will ensure a great response."
      s75: "37. How can we become a partner to advertise our services?"
      s76: "Contact one of the country managers directly via the team page or fill in the contact form. We will get back to you in less than twenty-four hours to talk about partnership possibilities."
      s77: "38. How can we become a sponsor?"
      s78: "Contact one of the country managers directly via the team page or fill in the contact form. We will get back to you in less than twenty-four hours to talk about sponsorship opportunities."
      s8: "4. How does the system rank students? How does it work?"
      s9: "The system relies on the only factor that can’t be cheated: time. We compare students based on their age and simply look at their accomplishments. Where did they invest their time? Do they have measureable achievements? How is their study progress? How many languages do they speak, and at what level? How much work or other experience do they have? All of these factors contribute points to the total score.  Once we have the total score, we can compare students with the same year of birth to create a fairer comparison group. Students can also choose to be compared with other groups, within their university or globally, or with other people that graduate at the same time. This may lead to different results and overall provides a more balanced view."
